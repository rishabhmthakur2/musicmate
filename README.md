The two folders represent the `backend` and the `frontend` of the project respectively

## frontend
To get the frontend code running, run the following steps:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## backend
To get the backend code running, run the following steps:
```
cd backend
npm install
node ./bin/www
```

## Future prospect 
We'll shortly be adding configurations to run both frontend and backend code together using the npm library `concurrently`
