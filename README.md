### frontend
To get the frontend code running, run the following steps:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### backend
To get the backend code running, run the following steps:
1. Run this code:
```
cd backend
npm install
```
2. Get the local env properties from someone in the team, and update the values in `local.env`
3. Run this code to start the server:
```
node bin/www
```

### Future prospect 
We'll shortly be adding configurations to run both frontend and backend code together using the npm library `concurrently`
